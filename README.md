# Boltzmann Code #

## Installation ##

The code is written in Python and requires Python version 2.6 or later (but not Python 3)
with the following *external* Python libraries:

 * `numpy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy>`_
 * `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy>`_
 * `Assimulo <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Assimulo>`_ >=2.9

In addition, some of the plotting functions may require:

 * `matplotlib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib>`_
 * `pyROOT <https://root.cern.ch/pyroot>`_

For a successful installation of Assilumo, `SUNDIALS <https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials>`_ must also be installed.

## Running BoltzmannCode ##

A basic example of how to run the code is provided in the example folder.
